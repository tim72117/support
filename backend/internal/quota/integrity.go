// Data-integrity checks for the billing ledger, surfaced in the admin
// back-office (internal/adminconsole's GET /admin/api/integrity).
//
// These exist because the ledger has invariants the schema alone cannot
// fully enforce, and a violation is silent by nature: usage simply comes out
// lower than it should, and nobody notices until the numbers are audited.
// The specific bug that motivated this file — usage_events.app_id being
// ON DELETE CASCADE, so deleting an app erased its billing history and reset
// the owner's monthly quota — was invisible in every existing surface,
// because the "correct" count was computed from whatever rows still existed.
//
// Each check is a counting query: 0 means healthy. They are deliberately
// cheap and read-only, so the admin page can run all of them on load.

// IntegrityCheck is one invariant's result. Count is how many rows violate
// it; OK is Count == 0. Detail explains what a non-zero count means, so the
// admin page doesn't have to hardcode an explanation per check.
