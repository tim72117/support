package quota

// This file is the single place plans are defined. A plan maps a
// subscription tier to the concrete limits that tier grants. Quota
// enforcement (quota.go) resolves a user's tier to a Plan here at check
// time and never reads a per-row copy of the number — so changing a plan's
// MonthlyTokens below immediately applies to every user on that tier, with
// no migration and no backfill. Add a new paid tier by adding one entry to
// plans and (optionally) a matching Tier constant.

// Tier is a subscription tier identifier, stored as subscriptions.tier.
// Kept as a plain string (not a DB enum) so a new tier is a code change
// here, never a schema migration.
